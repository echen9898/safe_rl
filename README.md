# Safe RL Transfer

An implementation of safe "sim to real world transfer" for a reinforcement learning agent. Work is an implementation of [this paper](http://interactive.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Ramakrishnan_AAAI_2019.pdf) on a real system. Project was done with [Ramya Ramakrishnan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ramyaram/) and MIT's [Interactive Robotics Group](https://interactive.mit.edu/).

### Usage

Implementation can be run in gazebo, or on a real remote control car. The car used for this project uses drivers found in "base", which communicates with the sparkfun board.
